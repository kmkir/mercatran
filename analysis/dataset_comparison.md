## Notes

- To our best awareness, only MerRec and Retailrocket [6] have item snapshots.
- Some columns (e.g. condition, shipment paying party) are omitted here to prevent the table from being too large.
- In practice, token estimates for DIGINETICA [4] and Retailrocket [6] should be higher than numbers shown here, as the stated numbers here represent counting over unique snapshots rather than all (possibly redundant) snapshots. MerRec estimate contains all snapshot instances.
- The Amazon (2023) [1] review dataset is not a conventional action event based recommendation dataset and cannot be used interchangeably with MerRec. These two do not generally conform to the same machine learning tasks.
- Retailrocket [6] hashed most of its item metadata field names, so it is unclear if it contains some of the metadata compared here.
- For Ali-CCP [7], we interpreted "impression" as "view", and "conversion" as "purchase".
- For Alibaba-iFashion [8], the tokens provided were mostly Chinese characters. If we define tokens as the number of Chinese characters (as well as other occasional English characters and numerics) instances instead of splitting by empty space, then the token count would be 164.18M.
